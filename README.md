Safari JSON Viewer
==================

Extremely simple JSON viewer for Safari (tested on Safari 7 and Safari 8). I built this because no other extensions quite did what I wanted, so I just built this viewer for myself and figured I'd share.

### How to install ###

1. Download the extension below.
2. Double-click to install.

By default, it should detect when you're viewing JSON and parse appropriately.
